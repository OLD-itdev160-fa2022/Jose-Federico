        <h2> What is Disctrated Driving? </h2>
           Distracted Driving is performing any activity that diverts or prevent a driver from focusing 100% on the road. This can inlcude:
            <ul>
                <li>texting</li>
                <li>talking on the phone</li>
                <li>eating or drinking</li>
                <li>or even messing with the stereo</li>
            </ul>
             However, for most drivers, texting is the biggest distraction of them all. If you simply distract your eyes off the road for 5 seconds, at 55 mph, you have driven almost an entire football field. That is a huge distance in which a lot of things can happen. According to the NHTSA, in 2018 alone, over 400,000 people were injured in car accidents caused by distracted driving, with around 2,800 of those people killed in said accidents.

        <h2> What can you do to help?
            </h2> 
            The easiest way to help is by not contributing to the problem. When driving, resist using your phone to look at that newly arrived text. Try not to mess around with the audio system while driving and never eat or do any other activity that would keep you from focusing %100 on the road.  <br><br>
            To help other around you be safe, you encourage friends and family to drive phone-free. Being a good passenger and speaking out to the driver of your vehicle if they are being distracted with something is also a good idea. If your life depends on someone else's driving, you want to make sure they are also aware of it.
